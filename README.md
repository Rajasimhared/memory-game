# memory-game

Remember in our early days of mobile revolution, we had this memory game with two dimensionl grid with multiple small boxes having images.This grid would flip after some time and we have to match the set of similar images by clicking on these boxes. 

I have recreated this experience for mobile and desktop just for fun. It is developed using the web components.

Additionally, you can try to increase the complexity by choosing your own grid size.
